# Design and Build a React Admin Dashboard and Template
## Chapter 8

Different from the folders of prior chapters, this folder contains two subfolders, frontend and backend. The backend is a sample that demonstrates how to construct a backend that works with our admin template Kiki. The frontend is our admin template that is slightly adapted to work with the backend.

### How to use the backend
