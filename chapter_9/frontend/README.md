# Design and Build a React Admin Dashboard and Template
## Chapter 9
### Frontend

To run the frontend locally, you will need to:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open your terminal, navigate into this folder, and run `npm install`. After all dependencies are installed, run `npm start`.

It is worth noting that the frontend we prepared for this chapter is an adaptation of our admin template Kiki, so it can work with the backend.
